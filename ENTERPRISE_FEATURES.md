- **Accessibility compliance** with proper ARIA labels

## üîß Technical Implementation

### File Upload Flow
1. **Authentication Check**: Verifies user is logged in and session is valid
2. **File Validation**: Runs comprehensive security checks on each file
3. **Storage Upload**: Securely stores files in Supabase Storage
4. **Database Recording**: Creates audit trail in file_uploads table
5. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress updates to user
6. **Security Logging**: All actions logged for compliance

### Authentication Flow
1. **Multi-Method Login**: Users can choose password, magic link, or Google
2. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with auto-refresh
3. **Organization Setup**: Automatic organization creation for new users
4. **Security Monitoring**: All auth events logged and monitored

### Security Features
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and spam attacks
- **Session Security**: Automatic session validation and cleanup
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose system details

## üöÄ Production Readiness Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Authentication system with multiple methods
- [x] Secure file upload with comprehensive validation
- [x] Session management and security monitoring
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] Input sanitization and XSS prevention
- [x] Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [x] Responsive design and accessibility
- [x] Production build optimization

### üìù Deployment Requirements
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure production Supabase keys are set
2. **HTTPS**: Deploy with SSL certificate (handled by Supabase/Vercel)
3. **CSP Headers**: Configure Content Security Policy (optional)
4. **Error Monitoring**: Set up error tracking (Sentry recommended)
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Configure analytics (Google Analytics/Mixpanel)

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Authentication Testing
1. **Sign Up**: Test with valid/invalid email formats
2. **Magic Link**: Test email delivery and link functionality
3. **Google OAuth**: Test OAuth flow and user creation
4. **Password Reset**: Test reset flow and new password setting
5. **Session Persistence**: Test session across browser tabs/refresh

### Upload Testing
1. **Valid Files**: Test CSV, Excel, PDF uploads
2. **Invalid Files**: Test rejection of .exe, .js, oversized files
3. **Network Issues**: Test upload resumption and error handling
4. **Concurrent Uploads**: Test multiple file uploads simultaneously
5. **Authentication**: Test upload attempts without login

### Security Testing
1. **Input Validation**: Test XSS attempts in forms
2. **File Validation**: Test malicious file upload attempts
3. **Rate Limiting**: Test rapid-fire requests
4. **Session Management**: Test session expiration handling
5. **CSRF Protection**: Test form submissions with invalid tokens

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Security Events Tracked
- User authentication (login/logout)
- File upload attempts (successful/failed)
- Invalid file upload attempts
- Session validation failures
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious activity detection

### Performance Metrics
- Upload success/failure rates
- Average upload processing time
- User authentication success rates
- Session duration and activity
- Error rates by category
